# Python Basics – Day 7 (Functions & Recursion)

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains my **Day 7 Python practice work**, focused on learning **functions and basic recursion** in Python.  
The goal of this day was to understand how to write reusable code blocks and how recursion works at a basic level.

---

## 📚 Topics Covered
- Functions in Python  
- Defining and calling functions  
- Function parameters  
- Return statement  
- Introduction to recursion  

---

## 📝 Tasks Completed

### 1️⃣ Simple Greeting Function
- Created a function that takes a name as a parameter  
- Prints a greeting message
